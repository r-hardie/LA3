# LA3 

A "Matrix" is a two-dimensional data structure including values that are organized into rows and columns. Each element in the matrix is accessed using two indices: the row number and the column number. In an MxN matrix, row numbers are in the range [1, M] and column numbers are in  the range [1, N].

The "Matrix" ADT can be implemented as a sequence of nodes including the following attributes:

- "value": The value of that node (i.e. the matrix element)
- "nextInRow": A pointer to the next element in the same row.
- "nextInColumn": A pointer to the next element in the same column.

The following example, shows how matrix "m" is represented in the memory.

**Part 1:**

Implement the "Matrix" ADT including:

- A default constructor that creates an empty matrix. 
- A parameterized constructor that creates a matrix including the values of a two-dimensional array.
- A copy constructor and a copy assignment operator.
- A move constructor and a move assignment operator.
- A destructor.
- A method that returns a specific row of the metrix. This method may throw an exception.
- A method that returns a specific column of the matrix. This method may throw an exception.
- A method that returns a specific element of the matrix. This method may throw an exception.
- A method that returns the transpose of the matrix as a Matrix object.
- Overload the addition operator to add two matrices of the same size. This method may throw an exception.
- Overload the multiplication operator to multiply two matrices of compatible sizes. This method may throw an exception.
- Overload the stream insertion operator to insert a matrix in the matrix format into an output stream.

**Part 2:**

Implement a forward iterator for the Matrix ADT that traverses the items of the matrix row by row.

**Part 3:**

Analyze the efficiency of your implementation and compare it with a contiguous implementation (i.e. using a two-dimensional array).
